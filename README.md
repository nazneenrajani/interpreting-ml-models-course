# Interpreting ML Models

This repo contains the projects for the course on [Interpreting ML Models](https://corise.com/course/interpreting-machine-learning-models?utm_source=nazneen)

It is a 4 week fast-paced hands-on course that covers a breadth of different interpretability approaches for deep learning models. 

Each week focuses on a different data modality including vision, text, and tabular data. We also discuss evaluation metrics for interpretability methods and their tradeoffs in Week 3.

I am grateful to [Praneeth](https://github.com/praneethd7) for helping with the project content and adding the nice storyline to make each project super engaging and 10x more fun! 

Here's the detailed syllabus for the course.
